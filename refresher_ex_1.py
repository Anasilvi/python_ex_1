# Python refresher exercises
# part 1 
# May 25, 2020

# This set of exercises uses topics from refreshers 1 and 2
# variables, basic data types and flow control
# I have just given you descriptions of tasks and what the result should look like.
# My solution is directly below, but with a visual buffer so you don't see it accidentally

# You should have gotten this file by forking the python_ex_1 project from my github
# repo: 

# How to work the exercises:
# Use a debugger to set a break point at the print() at the top of the solution part so you
# don't accidentally run beyond it and see the solution. This is the "end" breakpoint
# Set another "start" breakpoint at the print() that shows the start of each part
# write you code between those break points
# to run your code, start the debugger (will stop at the "start" breakpoint) and
# hit step or continue. Once you have your bug free solution, remove the start and
# end breakpoints and move on to the next part. Here's an example:


# part 1
# This is just a simple example to demonstrate how the start and end
# breakpoint system works
# Task: get the user's name with input() and print out hello <name>
print("start of part 1") # set breakpoint here
# your code here


print("end of 1") # set breakpoint here 
'''
























# solution 1
name = input("What's your name?")
print("Hello", name)
'''

# Before we really start, a couple more things:
# - your solution may be different or even better than what I showed
# - Please get in the habit of documenting your code as you go along
#   You don't need to state the obvious but you should point out anything 
#   that could be interesting later.
# - After you've finished the code for your part
